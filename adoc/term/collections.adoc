In sometimes you necessary to work with different system of terms, unrelated with any other.
For example two different languages or parts of science as math or physics.

In this cause were invented collections feature.
Its let customers option to group their terms and separate one terms from each other.

In the application collections forms as follow list of props. Look below:

 Name: id;
 Type: String;
 Desc: Simple UUID converted to string.
 Using to identify the unique collection by application.

 Name: userId;
 Type: String;
 Desc: Same as id field, but identify unique user.
 So collections of one user insnt shown for each other.

 Name: name
 Type: String
 Desc: Simple string value. Using to identify unique collection by customer. One user must have only one collection with specific name. But one name could be used by other users.

 Name: access
 Type: enum
 Desc: Field would be used for community-public collections. Community-public collection - ready to use published collections, which you can upload by url or from community market.

 Name: size
 Type: long
 Desc: Count of terms in collection. Havent kept into database, but will be found after getting current collection, inside application logic.

Firstly you will get one base collection named `Default` collection.
So you dont have to use collections functionality without pleasure.
Its not something static, you could rename or remove it.

Using rest you could access to follow list of methods:

 URL: {base_url}/collections
 Required: none
 Access: Applications Token
 Response: List of all collections stored on current server.
 Desc: An application layer endpoint. Could be used for debug, analytics and etc.

 URL: {base_url}/collections/user/{id}
 Required: params(String id)
 Access: Users Token
 Response: List of collections for the certain user
 Desc: A personal user's endpoint. Used in UI when we need to get list of collection, take common info and transfer somewhere or processing somehow.

Additionally collection could be gotten with list of terms.
